### Speaker notes

- Say how it's different from the live-coded example from YTT
    - ingress domains instead of ports
    - config map for the message
- Deploy with kubectl, show that it fails
- Deploy with kapp
- kapp inspect
    - Mention delete
- change the configmap with, deploy with --diff-changes
    - view version updates
